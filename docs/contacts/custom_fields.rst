You'll notice the group column shows the specific field on the Contact profile. In the last column, you may see several icons which signify various properties of the field:

1. **Lock icon** -  The core installation uses these fields, you can't remove them.

2. **List icon** - You can use these fields as filters for Segments.

3. **Asterisks icon** - These are mandatory when filling in the Contact Form

4. **Globe icon** - You can update these fields publicly through the :doc:`tracking pixel</configuration/variables>` URL query see :doc:`Contact Monitoring</contacts/manage_contacts>` for more details.

Adding a new Custom Field
*************************

.. vale on

You can create additional Custom Fields and define the data type you want that field to hold. In addition to the data type you select the group for that particular field. This defines where the field displays on the Contact edit and detail view.

Creating Custom Fields via a command
************************************

When you create a new Custom Field for Contacts or Companies in Mautic, the system adds a new column to the database. For larger instances of Mautic, this operation can slow down, and the table remains locked while running. As a result, you can't make any changes until the system creates the field. The ``HTTP`` request may time out, causing the User Interface to report that the column exists even though Contact/Company updates may fail because the column is still missing.

There is a way around this when you configure the processing of field creation in the background.

Since :xref:`Mautic 3` there is an option you can set in your ``app/config/local.php`` file: ``'create_custom_field_in_background' => true``,.

If you configure this option, the new Custom Field becomes visible in the list of Custom Fields. The Custom Field remains unavailable for use until you run the command ``bin/console mautic:custom-field:create-column``. This command creates the actual column in the table and the field metadata.

This configuration helps prevent **http** request timeouts because it handles the long-running SQL query to create the new table column as a background task.

To mitigate the table lock issue, run the command only once daily when you know that most of your audience is offline. With less traffic going into Mautic, the chances of encountering a problem are lower.
