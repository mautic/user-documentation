Engagements/Points chart
*************************

Engagements shown on the chart include any tracked action the Contacts made. Some examples might include page hits, Form submissions, Email opens and so on. The engagements line chart displays how active the Contacts of the Company were in the past 6 months. The chart displays also the sum of Points the Contacts received.

List of Contacts assigned
*************************

.. vale on

You can find a table with the list of the assigned Contacts displaying the date of their last activity, preceding the information of the Company which includes the Company name, address, and all the custom Company fields, and the engagement chart. This is good way to have a view of the recent activity of the Contacts you know in this Company.

Company duplicates
*******************
The Company name field is a unique identifier by default. You can choose any other Company field as unique identifier in the **Custom Fields** section.

In *Configuration > Company Settings* you can choose the operator used when merging Companies with multiple identifiers - either **AND** or **OR**.
