Troubleshooting HubSpot Integration
***********************************

.. vale on

When creating the Contact, ensure the email address you used to test is valid. HubSpot only creates a new Contact when the email address is valid.

Note, despite ``--fetch-all`` flag, the HubSpot API endpoints used in Mautic primarily leverage the following endpoints:

* ``/companies/v2/companies/recent/modified/``

* ``/contactslistseg/v1/lists/recently_updated/contacts/recent``
  
If you intend to do a full sync of your HubSpot Contacts, you need to modify an attribute of each so that they appear in HubSpot's recent/modified endpoints. 
When connecting to a long-lived HubSpot instance, these endpoints pull only Contacts modified in the last 30 days, resulting in an incomplete sync. :xref:`Source`
