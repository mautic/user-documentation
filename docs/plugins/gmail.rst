2024 June  -this plugin no longer works -as evidenced by comments in the Forums since 2022 - eg https://forum.mautic.org/t/mautic-gmail-plugin/22354

This plugin enables the Mautic Helper Chrome Extension to track emails sent to leads directly from GMail.

Requirements:

1. A publicly accessible Mautic installation.

2. A GMail account (for email tracking).

3. Mautic Helper Chrome Extension.

Plugin Configuration:

Follow these steps to configure the Plugin:

1. Install the Mautic Plugin as usual. It'll appear on the Plugins page in Mautic.

2. Click on the GMail Plugin button and enter a secret or key to validate the Mautic Helper Chrome Extension

3. Install the Mautic Helper Chrome Extension from the Chrome Web Store

4. Configure the extension using the options page that will automatically be displayed. (Remember to use the same secret you entered in Mautic)

5. On the Chrome browser there will be a button that will notify of new events on the contacts timeline.

6. To track an email sent to a lead, click the Track Email button on the Compose window in GMail

7. This appends a tracking GIF to the email with the following syntax: ``[[MAUTIC_URL]]/index.php/gmail/tracking.gif?d=H4sIAAAAAAAEAIVRTW%2FCMAz9LRyCtgNVlFBpHHroWsRuk8ak7RpaUzqaGCUp0H8%2Fpy0TH4dJUZy892w921uLOvkCa8BGK2WLWi2dt6pUbM7PYPEcFainoFXdJKdBVvUy4quA9rxrNz9Q%2BCQ16HdgmeAenKewpfIU3lvfIO6nGyy75HNXO8LQAN3984R2X5tqMpkwnjOejrfg19%2FBJIHBJsskS3M1MOvOedChUA5HaPBAsp54a7UyBH%2BAw9YWECRrsMc6PHvFd2iR0NfW1QbcjUDwMjhctYqqq0YxkQU6SqMhNxi85GeoD8p0134zaBom%2By4ezlPMxTPFeCH5TLzI%2BdgizeEu5aIUQixmIubjSG5WAY8bC8kyC%2FvxSBX%2Flcvl3bT%2Fvr8k1oBgIQIAAA%3D%3D&sig=cf078d5b``

8. The Mautic Plugin will then validate the information using the secret to compare signatures and then attach that email to the contactâ€™s profile as part of their activity history. If the lead or leads don't exist, they are created automatically

URL Parameter Length Issue
**************************

.. vale on

Please note that PHP setups with the Suhosin patch installed will have a default limit of 512 characters for get parameters.

Although bad practice, most browsers (including IE) supports URLs up to around 2000 characters, while Apache has a default of 8000.

To add support for long parameters with Suhosin add the following to ``php.ini``:

``suhosin.get.max_value_length = 5000``
