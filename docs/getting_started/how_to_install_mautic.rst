Installation
############

There are several ways to install Mautic, you should select the most appropriate method for your situation and technical knowledge.

- Installing :ref:`using the production package<Using the production package>`, with either the :ref:`web-based installer<using the web-based installer>` or :ref:`from the command line<Installing with command line>`.

- Installing locally by :ref:`cloning from GitHub<Installing from GitHub>` - for testing and local development,

- :ref:`Installing with Composer`

Using the production package
****************************

You can install the Mautic production package either by uploading the zipped installation package into the server location or using the command-line installation. The Mautic production package also requires access to a database server.

The Mautic installation is a three-step process:

1. Integrate the database server with the Mautic server.
   
2. Create an administrator account to access the Mautic server.
   
3. Set up the Email server for Email marketing automation.

Preparing for installation
==========================

Before installing a package, ensure that:

* Your server environment meets the minimum requirements for the version you are installing. Read more in :xref:`Mautic's Requirements`.
  
* Your server directory is writable by the Mautic web server.
  
* Your database meets the minimum requirements for the supported databases and valid User permissions to access to the database. Read more in :xref:`Mautic's Requirements`.
  
* Your server has enough free disk space to run the installation. Consider the database size as well.
  
* PHP's ``max_execution_time`` is at least 240 seconds.

Downloading a production package
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To get started :xref:`Download Mautic` to access the zip file of the latest stable release. 

For more information about the available Mautic packages, visit the :xref:`Mautic Releases` Landing Page.

Uploading the production package
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

After downloading a desired package, upload the package zip file to your web server, and unzip it in the directory where you plan to host the Mautic instance.

Your web server must have the permissions to access the unzipped files.

Using the web-based installer
=============================

To access the Mautic server from your browser, enter the URL that corresponds to the Mautic instance (for example, `https://m.example.com`) in your web browser. It's recommended to secure your installation with an SSL certificate (https).

Conducting environment checks
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

After loading the package in the server, the Mautic installer validates if it can run successfully in your server environment. 

You must resolve installation errors, displayed in red, before completing the Mautic package installation successfully. Warnings, displayed in orange, are often recommendations for a better Mautic experience.

.. image:: images/mautic-install-pre-flight-check.png
  :width: 600
  :alt: Screenshot showing Mautic pre-flight checks with warning about installing on a non-SSL connection

If the environment checks are successful - displayed in green - click **Next Step** to begin the installation process.

Integrating the database
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Mautic assumes that the database is on the same server as Mautic.  

For setting the database server on the **Mautic Installation-Database Setup** window:

* Select **Database Driver**.
  
* Enter **Database Host**.
  
* Enter **Database Name**.
  
* Enter **Database Username**.
  
* If desired, you can also enter values for **Database Port**, **Database Table Prefix**, **Database Password**, and **Prefix for backup tables**.
  
* **Backup existing tables?** is on by default, but you should turn it off for a new installation.

Click **Next Step**.

Creating the administrator account
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To create an Administrator account for your Mautic instance, enter values for the different fields on the **Mautic Installation - Administrative User** window. 

.. image:: images/mautic-create-admin-user.png
  :width: 600
  :alt: Screenshot showing the create User screen

Click **Next Step**.

.. vale off

Configuring Email settings
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. vale on 

To configure your Email settings for your Mautic instance, enter details of your Email provider on the **Mautic Installation - Email Configuration** window. You can use a tool such as :xref:`Mailhog` to configure a local instance for testing. 

.. image:: images/mautic-email-configuration.png
  :width: 600
  :alt: Screenshot showing the Email configuration screen

For configuring your Email sender settings:

* Enter the name and Email address to use with all outgoing Email communications by default. Verify that the provided Email address has been successfully authorized by your Email provider.
  
* **Queue** Emails and send them through a cron job - to trigger the queue processing - instead of sending them immediately for larger instances of Email handling.
  
* Select **Mailer transport**. If your provider isn't listed, select **Other SMTP Server** and provide the SMTP credentials. API-based sending is significantly faster than SMTP. Depending on the provider you select, additional fields appear to allow you to enter API keys and select regions.
  
* Enter **Server** and **Port** for your Email provider.
  
* Select **Encryption** and **Authentication mode** for your Email provider.

Click **Next Step** to log into the Mautic server.

Logging into Mautic
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

On the Mautic login window, enter your Mautic administrator credentials to log into your Mautic instance. 

.. image:: images/mautic-login-screen.png

  :alt: Screenshot of Mautic login screen

Click **login** to continue working on your Mautic instance.

Installing with command line
============================

You can also install Mautic using the command line. You can either pass the settings parameters in the command, or create a local PHP file with your database settings. You can also define properties in this file using the syntax expected by the command-line options. Note that Mautic requires a complex password from version 5.1.

Use the command ``path/to/php bin/console mautic:install --help`` for the list of options and flags available.

.. code-block:: php

     --db_driver=DB_DRIVER                    Database driver. [default: "pdo_mysql"]

Use the syntax below within a ``local.php`` file:

.. code-block:: php

  <?php
  // Example local.php to test install (to adapt of course)
  $parameters = array(
    // Do not set db_driver and mailer_from_name as they are used to assume Mautic is installed
    'db_host' => 'localhost',
    'db_table_prefix' => null,
    'db_port' => 3306,
    'db_name' => 'mautic',
    'db_user' => 'mautic',
    'db_password' => 'mautic',
    'db_backup_tables' => false,
    'db_backup_prefix' => 'bak_',
    'admin_email' => 'admin@example.com',
    'admin_password' => 'Maut1cR0cks!',
    'mailer_transport' => null,
    'mailer_host' => null,
    'mailer_port' => null,

    'mailer_password' => null,
    'mailer_api_key' => null,
    'mailer_encryption' => null,
    'mailer_auth_mode' => null,
  );

Installing with a local PHP file
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 

Run the following command after replacing the path to PHP bin and Mautic instance URL. 

``path/to/php bin/console mautic:install https://m.example.com``

If desired, you can also add parameters in the install command:

.. code-block:: php

  path/to/php bin/console mautic:install https://m.example.com
  --mailer_from_name="Example From Name" --mailer_from_email="mautic@localhost"
  --mailer_transport="smtp" --mailer_host="localhost" --mailer_port="1025"
  --db_driver="pdo_mysql" --db_host="db" --db_port="3306" --db_name="db" --db_user="db" --db_password="db" 
  --db_backup_tables="false" --admin_email="admin@mautic.local" --admin_password="Maut1cR0cks!"

As the installation process begins, it flags up warnings and aborts if there are any critical errors.

.. code-block:: shell

Installing from GitHub
**********************

It's essential to have all the files locally - including automated tests - from the GitHub repository when testing Mautic or contributing to it. Many of these files aren't included in the production build process.

Cloning Mautic from GitHub
==========================

1. Install the :xref:`GitHub CLI` tool.

2. Click **Fork** at the top-right corner of the Mautic GitHub repository page to make a personal fork. You can also click to go directly to your fork if you already have one, if you don't then GitHub will offer to create one..

3. After the fork is complete, click the green **Code** button to access the command for cloning the repository.

4. Switch to your terminal, and when in the directory where you wish to install Mautic, paste the command using the :xref:`GitHub CLI` tool this is in the format:

.. code-block:: shell
  
  gh repo clone username/mautic

.. note:: 

  Please always choose to fork into a **personal account** rather than an organization. The latter prevents Mautic's maintainers from working with your Pull Request.

Install Mautic using DDEV
==========================

You can use :xref:`DDEV` which is recommended for testing and development with Mautic. To get started:


#.  Install :xref:`DDEV`.

#.  Install and ensure you have :xref:`Docker` running on your system.

#.  You can now change into the Mautic directory and kick off the DDEV quickstart using the command:
   
.. code-block:: shell
  
    ddev start

.. note:: 

  For troubleshooting see :xref:`DDEV Troubleshooting`.

  See Mautic's :xref:`Handbook` for more detailed instructions.

.. vale off

This spins up a DDEV instance (which includes Mailhog, PHPMyAdmin, and Redis Commander) - by default at ``https://mautic.ddev.site`` - and also gives the option to set up Mautic ready for you to use.
.. vale on

This runs through the Composer install process, and installs Mautic at the command line with a default username of ``admin`` and password of ``Maut1cR0cks!`` (note: pre Mautic 5.1 the password is just `mautic`.

Installing with Composer
************************

Since :xref:`Mautic 4` it's possible to install and manage Mautic using the full power of Composer. Mautic uses the latest version of :xref:`Composer`.

Mautic is in the process of decoupling Plugins and Themes from core, however at present while they have been technically mirrored out into separate repositories, the source files remain in the main :xref:`Mautic GitHub repository`.

When you clone from GitHub, running ``composer install`` installs all the dependencies, there are some other handy features which you can take advantage of when installing and managing Mautic.

.. vale off

Using the Recommended Project
=============================

.. vale on

The Mautic :xref:`Recommended Project` is a template which provides a starter kit for managing your Mautic dependencies with Composer.

.. note::
  The instructions below refer to the global Composer installation. You might need to replace Composer with ``php composer.phar`` or something similar for your setup.

The basic command to use the Recommended Project is:

.. code-block:: shell

  composer create-project mautic/recommended-project:^5 some-dir --no-interaction

With Composer you can add new dependencies to install along with Mautic:

.. code-block:: shell

  cd your-directory
  composer require mautic/mautic/helloworld-bundle

The Composer ``create-project`` command passes ownership of all files to the created project. You should create a new git repository, and commit all files not excluded by the .gitignore file.

.. vale off

What does the Recommended Project template actually do?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. vale on

When installing the given ``composer.json`` the following occurs:

- Install Mautic in the ``docroot`` directory.
- Autoloader uses the generated Composer autoloader in ``vendor/autoload.php``, instead of the one provided by Mautic in ``docroot/vendor/autoload.php``.
- Plugins - packages of type ``mautic-plugin`` - are in ``docroot/plugins/``.
- Themes - packages of type ``mautic-theme`` - are in ``docroot/themes/``.
- Creates ``docroot/media`` directory.
- Creates environment variables based on your ``.env`` file. See ``.env.example``.

.. vale off

Composer FAQs
=============

.. vale on 

Should you commit downloaded third party Plugins?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Composer says that the :xref:`Composer commit dependencies`. They provide arguments against but also workarounds if a project decides to do it anyway.

Should you commit the scaffolding files?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The :xref:`Mautic Composer scaffold` Plugin can download the scaffold files - for example ``index.php``, ``.htaccess`` - to the ``docroot/`` directory of your project.


If you haven't customized those files you could choose to not commit them in your version control system - for example, git. If that's the case for your project it might be convenient to automatically run the Mautic Scaffold Plugin after every install or update of your project.

.. vale off

You can achieve that by registering ``@composer mautic:scaffold`` as post-install and post-update command in your composer.json:

.. vale on

.. code-block:: json

  "scripts": {
      "post-install-cmd": [
          "@composer mautic:scaffold",
          "..."
      ],
      "post-update-cmd": [
          "@composer mautic:scaffold",
          "..."
      ]
  },

How can you apply patches to downloaded Plugins?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you need to apply patches - depending on the Plugin, a pull request is often a better solution - you can do so with the ``composer-patches`` Plugin.

To add a patch to Mautic Plugin foobar insert the patches section in the extra section of ``composer.json``:


.. code-block:: json

  "extra": {
      "patches": {
          "mautic/foobar": {
              "Patch description": "URL or local path to patch"
          }
      }
  }

.. vale off

How can you specify a PHP version?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. vale on

This project supports PHP 7.4 as the minimum version currently - review :xref:`Mautic's Requirements` however, it's possible that a Composer update may upgrade some package that could then require PHP 7+ or 8+.

To prevent this you can add this code to specify the PHP version you want to use in the config section of ``composer.json``:

.. code-block:: json

  "config": {
      "sort-packages": true,
      "platform": {
          "php": "7.4"
      }
  },


How can you use another folder than ``docroot`` as the root folder?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

By default the ``composer.json`` file places all Mautic core, Plugin and Theme files in the ``docroot`` folder.
It's possible to change this folder to your own needs.

In following examples, ``docroot`` moves into ``public``.

New installations
-----------------

* Run the create-project command without installing:

.. code-block:: bash
  
  composer create-project mautic/recommended-project:^4 some-dir --no-interaction --no-install

* Do a find and replace in the ``composer.json`` file to change ``docroot/`` into ``public/``
* Review the changes in the ``composer.json`` file to ensure that there are no unintentional replacements
* Run ``composer install`` to install all dependencies in the correct location

Existing installations
----------------------

* Move the ``docroot/`` to ``public/``

.. code-block:: bash

  mv docroot public

* Do a find and replace in the ``composer.json`` file to change ``docroot/`` to ``public/``
* Review the changes in the ``composer.json`` file to ensure that there are no unintentional replacements
* Run ``composer update --lock`` to ensure the autoloader is aware of the changed folder

.. vale off

Setting up a local testing environment with DDEV
************************************************

.. vale on

Often there is a need to have a local environment for testing Mautic - for example making a backup, testing new features or bug fixes.

In Mautic, DDEV is the tool of choice for this purpose. It's very easy to work with.

To learn how to set up DDEV with Mautic, please review the documentation in the Contributors :xref:`Handbook`.
