Categories are a way to organize Mautic elements. They're available for Assets, Campaigns, Emails, Focus Items, Forms, Pages, Points, Social Monitoring and Stages. There are two ways to use Categories:

1. Create element-specific Categories for example only for Assets, Emails or Forms.
2. Create global Categories for all Mautic elements.

When creating a new Category you can select type, title, description, alias, color and available status. The color will be helpful to quickly find Mautic elements by their appropriate Category when viewing things like the Calendar or other areas within Mautic.

In addition to organizing various Mautic elements Categories can help you organize Contacts. In Contact details use the Preference menu to open Contact Preference Center.
