Categories are a way to organize Mautic elements. They're available for Assets, Campaigns, Emails, Focus Items, Forms, Pages, Points, Social Monitoring and Stages. There are two ways to use Categories:

1. Create element-specific Categories for example only for Assets, Emails or Forms.
2. Create global Categories for all Mautic elements.

When creating a new Category you can select type, title, description, alias, color and availability status. The color will be helpful to quickly find Mautic elements by their appropriate Category when viewing other areas within Mautic.
