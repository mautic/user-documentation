Type of Text Messages
*********************

.. vale on

Mautic allows you to create two types of Text Messages, in the same way as you can create different types of Emails.

Template Text Messages
======================

.. vale on

A template Text Message is automatically sent by Campaigns, Forms, Point triggers etc. You can edit Template Text Messages after creation, but they can't manually send them to a Contact list.

.. vale off

Segment Text Messages
=====================

.. vale on 

A Segment Text Message can be manually sent to Contact lists - Segments - in Mautic. Once sent, you can't edit the Text Message, however you can send it to new Contacts as they join the associated Segment.

Note that these are marketing Text Messages by default, and each Contact can only receive the Text Message once - it's the same principle as a mailing list.

You must initiate the send of Segment Text Messages with the ``Send Scheduled Broadcast`` cron job. See :doc:`cron jobs documentation </set_up/cron_jobs>` for more information.

Sending Text Messages as a Marketing Messages
=============================================

.. vale on

Mautic allows you to create a single message - for example 'Red shoes on offer today!' - in multiple Channels, and have it delivered through the Channel which the Contact prefers. This means that they only receive the message once, and through their preferred Channel. You can create the messages under the :doc:`/channels/marketing_messages` section.

If a Contact's preferred Channel is Text Messages, Mautic delivers the message through the Text Message Channel when a Marketing Message includes a Text Message.

Managing unsubscribes
*********************

.. note::
    In order for Mautic to process Text Message replies for unsubscribes and replies to messages, you must first configure the Webhook. For more information review the :doc:`/plugins/twilio` documentation.

Contacts can unsubscribe from your Text Messages by replying with the word ``STOP``, or any of the accepted phrases (``STOP``, ``STOPALL``, ``UNSUBSCRIBE``, ``CANCEL``, ``END``, and ``QUIT``), to your SMS.  Once Mautic receives this SMS, Mautic flags the specific Contact as 'Do Not Contact' (DNC) for the SMS Channel, and won't allow messages again via this Channel unless the Contact manually re-subscribes at a later date.

You can also view SMS replies in the Contact timeline:

Working with replies to Text Messages
*************************************

.. vale on

In a Mautic Campaign, where Mautic has an active Text Message provider, there is a Campaign Action called 'Sends a Text Message' which allows you to monitor incoming replies for specific patterns and take action accordingly.

  .. image:: images/sms/sms_reply_campaigns.png
    :width: 400
    :alt: Screenshot showing the Campaign action 'Sends a Text Message'

This decision tracks replies to your messages and looks for specified patterns within a message. This isn't dependent on you first sending the Contact a message.

For example, you can specify 'red' in 'Pattern the reply should match'. If your message contains language, such as reply from the Contact using the word 'Red' to a question of their favourite shoe colour, Mautic looks for incoming Text Messages with that pattern. In this example, you may add an action on the decision's Yes path for adding a colour preference to the Contact's profile.

Important notes
***************

- Contact phone numbers should be in the format +XXXXXXX including the + and with no spaces
- There must be a phone number in the Mobile Phone Contact field
- When configuring the Twilio Plugin, the sender number must be in the format +XXXXXXX and this number associated with the Twilio account
