Welcome to the Mautic end user documentation editor., open

We've already set up everything you need. To get started, follow these steps:
1. Open a file in the `docs/` folder (files that end with `.rst` are docs files)
2. Click the magnifier icon in the top right corner to see a LIVE preview of the file you're editing

Pretty cool, right?

Happy writing.
